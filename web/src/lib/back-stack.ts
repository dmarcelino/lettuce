/**
 * The phone's Back button closes the top modal, not the app.
 *
 * Every open overlay owns one browser-history entry. Back pops it (popstate)
 * and the top overlay closes. An overlay closed on screen instead leaves its
 * entry behind; that "stale" entry is removed with a deferred `history.back()`
 * whose popstate is ignored — deferred, because an overlay often replaces
 * another in the same render ("New agent" closes the switcher and opens the
 * agent editor), and the new one simply takes over the stale entry.
 *
 * An overlay whose close returns `false` cannot be dismissed (an approval
 * prompt): Back is swallowed and its entry re-pushed, so the app neither
 * closes the prompt nor exits underneath it.
