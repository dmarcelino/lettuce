"""Run workspace-mcp exactly as /policy/sidecar.json says, and nothing else.

The BFF writes that file (Settings -> Google, bff/src/google/). It lives on a
volume the app-server never mounts, so no agent can change it. Everything that
widens or narrows what agents can do in Google is decided here, at launch:

  * `--permissions` from the file, which is also what workspace-mcp filters
    its tools by;
  * a clean environment, so no inherited WORKSPACE_MCP_* variable can add to
    it (workspace-mcp reads env fallbacks for its mode flags);
  * the one tool that starts an OAuth consent, removed — the BFF owns consent;
  * server-side file paths refused, or an agent could attach /creds to a mail.

The file is polled; any change restarts the server with the new arguments. When
it says disabled (or is missing, or unreadable) nothing listens at all.
