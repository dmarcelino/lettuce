/**
 * Augments `get_tree` entries with real modification times and file sizes,

 * (`docker/compose.yml`).
 *
 * `get_tree` reports only `{path, type}` — no mtime, no size — and the fork
 * that owns the protocol cannot be patched (see CLAUDE.md's zero-fork-delta
 * rule). This never changes which entries are returned, only adds fields to
 * ones the app-server already decided to return, so it cannot show anything
 * `get_tree` itself would have filtered out (symlinks, `.lettaignore`
 * matches, etc.).
 *
 * A stat failure (file removed between the list and this call) just omits
 * both fields for that entry rather than failing the whole response.
 * `size` is omitted for directories on purpose: a directory inode's own
 * size is not a measure of what it contains, so showing one would be
 * actively misleading rather than merely absent.
