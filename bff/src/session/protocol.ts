 * string, and the constant exists to advertise the list in `DeviceStatus`. An
 * unknown id is answered `success: false`, not refused at the boundary. So
 * admitting the command type at all means admitting every id the handler knows,
 * and one of those is not something a browser should ever be able to trigger:
 *
 * - `upgrade-letta-code` runs `manualUpdate()` and then
 *   `scheduleRemoteRestart()`, which spawns a replacement listener and calls
 *   `process.exit()` (letta-code `listener/commands.ts`). Against this stack
 *   that swaps the installed global out from under a pinned image, silently
 *   breaking the invariant `scripts/check-version-pin.ts` exists to hold, and
 *   restarts the process that owns every conversation's turn.
 * - `channels` needs a gateway attached over stdio; see CLAUDE.md.
 * - `secret` and `toolset` have no `execute_command` case at all — the UI's
 *   toolset picker uses `update_toolset`, and the Secrets screen uses the
 *   dedicated `secret_list`/`secret_apply` commands above. Neither slash id is
 *   reachable here, and neither needs to be.
 *
 * Everything listed here is a conversation-scoped operation the UI actually
 * offers. Mod-contributed commands are allowed too, but only ones the
 * app-server has actually advertised (see `advertisedModCommands` in
 * `registry.ts`), so the palette and the boundary cannot disagree.
