/**
 * The workspace clamp in `protocol.ts` is lexical: it normalises `.` and `..`
 * and checks the result is under `/work`. That closes traversal, but a symlink
 * is not traversal — `/work/agent-1/link/settings.json` is lexically inside
 * the workspace and resolves anywhere the link points.
 *
 * The app-server does not resolve links either. `read_file` calls `readFile`
 * directly and `write_file` writes through, with no `realpath` or `lstat`
 * anywhere in `websocket/listener/file-commands.ts`. So an agent — which can
 * create symlinks, and whose `skill_enable` symlinks directories into
 * `/root/.letta/skills` by design — can plant
 * `/work/<id>/link -> /root/.letta` and read or write through it from a
 * browser request that passes every lexical check.
 *
 * The fix is to check each component on the way down rather than the whole
 * path at the end. If no component of a path is a symlink, then every
 * component is a real directory and the resolved path IS the path, so a
 * component-wise `lstat` is sufficient — no `realpath` needed, and nothing
 * follows a link in the process of checking it.
 *
 * This runs in the BFF against its own read-only bind of the same host
 * directory (`docker/compose.yml`), so it sees exactly the tree the
 * app-server will write to, and cannot itself be tricked into writing.

/**
 * Why this path escapes through a symlink, or null when it does not.
 *
 * A component that does not exist is NOT a violation: `write_file` creates
 * parents, so the tail of a legitimate new-file path is routinely absent.
 * Only a component that exists and is a symlink refuses. Anything else the
 * `lstat` throws for (permissions, ELOOP) is treated as a refusal too —
 * being unable to prove a path safe is not the same as proving it safe, and
 * `ELOOP` in particular is a symlink cycle saying exactly that.
