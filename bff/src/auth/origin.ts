/**
 * Cross-site WebSocket protection.
 *
 * A WebSocket handshake is not subject to CORS. The session cookie is what
 * authenticates the socket, and `SameSite=Lax` does not cover WebSocket
 * upgrades — so without an Origin check, any page the signed-in user visits
 * can open a socket to this BFF and act as them for the whole session.
 *
 * Browsers always send `Origin` on a WebSocket upgrade. A non-browser client
 * (the smoke script, a CLI) may omit it, and the app-server itself rejects an
 * unauthenticated upgrade that carries an `Origin` — so an absent header is
 * treated as "not a browser" and allowed, while a present one must match.
 *
 * What "match" means depends on the mode:
 *
 * - **cloudflared**: the Origin must be exactly `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`. Cloudflare
 *   rewrites `Host` to the origin's own address, so the request's Host is not
 *   the user-facing origin and cannot be compared against. The declared public
 *   origin is the only trustworthy answer here, and pinning it also means a
 *   Host-header injection cannot smuggle a different origin through.
 * - **local**: the app is reached directly, often by LAN IP or `localhost`
 *   with a port that varies between dev and the container. Requiring an exact
 *   match against `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` would break legitimate access, so the rule
 *   is same-origin: the Origin's host and port must equal the request's `Host`
 *   header. That is exactly the property cross-site requests violate, and it
 *   holds however the machine is addressed.
 *
 *   A loopback Origin is additionally accepted in this mode, because the Vite
 *   dev server proxies `/ws` with `changeOrigin` and so presents
 *   `Origin: http://localhost:5173` against a different `Host`. That is not a
 *   weakening: the cross-site attack requires the attacker's page to carry the
 *   victim's cookie to this server, and a page served from a remote host can
 *   never have a loopback Origin. Only something already running on this
 *   machine does.
